# UCF_101_CLASSIFICATION_TASK_MT

This repository contains the code developed to extract and process features from the dataset UCF-101 using DenseTrajectories.  

Having extracted these features, a Neural Network at trajectory-patch level is trained in order to classify the activity that is being executed in the video (i.e: playing a piano, walking, ...). In order to do that, it has been proposed different voting schemes.
